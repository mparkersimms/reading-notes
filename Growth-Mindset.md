* Having a growth mindset in comparison to a fixed mindset is crucial to *improve*, *grow*, and *learn*, in an educational setting. 
* Being able to overcome obstacles, embrace challenges and remain inspired by the success of others are all key elements to a growth mindset. 
* On the contrary, in the same setting a fixed mindset will find obstacles to be disheartening and will stunt growth. 
* A fixed mindset may also see the success of others as a challenge to their own ability and become defensive and apprehensive to those individuals for their success. 
* Thus a growth mindset helps foster a learning environment, as well as a cohesive community and group of fellow learners.
