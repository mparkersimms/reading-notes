## Version Control 
* *Version Control system (VCS)*
* a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of filess by recording changes
* you can revert a file to a previous version
* track modifications and the people that made the modifications
* compare changes

### Local Version Control
* entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files

### Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)

* single server, accessed by all clients
* streamlined by eliminating the need for all local databases

### Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
* addresses major vulnerability of the CVS (the server as a single point of failure) 
  * if a CVS goes down, noone can do any work
  * with the absense
