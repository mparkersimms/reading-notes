## Linked Lists

There are two types of linked lists, singly linked, and doubly linked. 

Singly means that each node has one reference in them
doubly means there are two references in each node. 

When traversing a linked list, you cant use for or foreach loops, we depend on the "Next" value of each node. 

Make sure that each node has a value, and points to the next node in the sequence.
