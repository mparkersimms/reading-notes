## Packages and imports

Packages are directories

There are a few different ways to import packages to use in your code, 

- import using the wildcard option (*) 
- import by calling the specific package by name, 
- or by calling the root location of the package in your code

## Loops 

Loops in Java are a lot like javascrip loops, 

There are for loops, while loops, do while loops, and for each loops;

All loops will continue to run as long as the controlling boolean evaluates as true.
