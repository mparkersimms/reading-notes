## Inheritance
In java, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass, and every superclass can potentially have unlimited subclasses. 

Each class inherites the traits of the superclass, but the superclass does not inherite the traits of the subclasses. 

to denote a subclass use the keyword "extends"

example " class MountainBike extends Bicycle {

}"

## Interface

Methods form the object's interface. 

Implementing an interface allows the class to be more formal about its behavior. "Interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world ."
