## Object Oriented Design

SOLID is the accronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD)  priciples

SOLID stands for 
S: single-responsibility principle
O: open-clodes principle
L: liskov substitution princicple
I: interface segregation principle
D: dependency inversion principle

### Single Responsibiliy Principle

"A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job."

### Open Closed Principle

"Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification."

### Liskov Substitution Principle

"Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T."

"This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class."

### Interface Segregation Principle 

"A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use."

### Dependency Inversion Principle

"Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions."
