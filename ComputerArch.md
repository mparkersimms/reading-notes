## What makes a computer a computer

designed to help people with *thinking* work 

### input 
 - What we tell the computer what to do

### Storage 
- holds and stores information

### processing 
- What the computer does to the stored information or data

### output
- what the computer does with the processed data

## How computers Work 
- storing and processing information with electricity
- using a wire the information is a binary number system
- computers use "0" "1"
- any number can be represented by 1s and 0s
- use a wire thats turned on or off
- Text, images, and sounds can also be represented by the binary system
- images made up of pixels, and the pixels are made up of colors and colors are represented by numbers 
- sound is graphically represented by waveform that are then represented by numbers on a graph, 
-the larger the number of "bits" the more quality 


## circuits and logic
- every input and output of a computer is just information 
- represented by the 1s and 0s
- circuits change signles from the input to the output
- every operation is just a combination of lots of litte simple circuits
- the smaller the circuit is the faster it is becuase the electricity doesnt have to travel as far


## Memory, CPU, input and output
- input devices take information from the outside world and turn it into binary
-examples keyboard, thermostat etc. 
- memory stores information
- CPU decifers what to do with the binary information and processes it


## HArdwar and Software
- circuits, chips, wires, plugs, speakers, are the hardware
- codes, apps, games, websites are the software
- CPU central processing unit
    - master chip
    - chips to do math logic
    - send and recieve information
    - knows which circuits to use and when
- evertything is just on and off (1 and0) 
- binary code controls everything
- commands are turned into binary code and then it is used by the computer
- the operating system 
    - the master program that manages how software uses the hardware 
    - tells all the other programs and CPU what to do and when to do it
    - software that controls the hardware
