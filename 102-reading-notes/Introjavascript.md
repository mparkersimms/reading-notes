### How JAvascript makes web pages more interactive

1. Access Content - select selevted text, select certain elements
2. Modify Content - you can add text, trigger new rules, and change the size and position of images
3. Program Rules- specify a set of steps for the browser to follow, 
4. React to Events - specify a script to run when a button is pushed or a link is clicked or when a cursor moves over an element etc. 

### Examples of Javascript in the Browser

- rely on the ability to 
    - access the conten
    - modify the content
    - program rules or instructions
    - react to events triggered by the user 

### What is a script

#### a script is a series of instructions
- made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step
- browser may use different parts of the dcript depending on how the user ineteracts with the web page
- can run different sections of the code in response to the situation around them

#### writing a script
- first stat the goal and then list the tasks that need to be comleted 
- always supply enough information to the computer to do the task to be completed everytime it does
- start witht eh big picture
    - define the goal
        - (the puxxle you want the computer to solve)
    - Design the script
        - split the goal into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving the puzzle
        - write down the individual steps that the computer needs to perform
    - Code each step
        - each step needs to be coded in a language the computer can recognize
- get to grips with the 
    - vocabulary - the words that computers understand
    - sytax - how you put those words together io creat instructions computers can follow
- use a programmatic approach to problem solving!
- learn to think like a computer becuase they solve tasks in a different way
    - computers follow a serties of tasks 

- defining a goal and designing the script
    - detail the goal for the script
    - next, break it down into a series of tasks in order to accomplish the goal

- sketching out the tasks in a flow chart
    - often scripts need to perform different task in different situations, 
    - use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together
    - flowchart key-
        - generic step
        - event
        - input or output
        - decision

- Expressions
    - evaluates in to (results in ) a single value. 
    - two types
        - expressions that just assign a value
            - done by using the "assingment operator" or (equals sign)
            - color, number, etc. 

        - expression that use two or more values to return a single value
            
    - rely on things called operators, they allow programmers to creat a single value form one or more values
        - assignment operator =
            - assigning a value
        - arithmetic operators
            - perform basic math
            - adds + 
            - subtracts - 
            - division / 
            - multiplies * 
            - increment ++ ( adds one number to the current number)
            - decrement -- 
            - modulus % ( divides two numbers and returns the remander)

            - order of execution 
                - mulitplicatipon and division happen before add and subtract
                - to have somehting happen first, place them in  () 
        - string operators
            - combine two strings ( '  ' + '  '  ) 
            - there is just one string operator the + symbol 
            - the process of joining two or more strings is called **concatenation**
            - placing numbers inside ' ' makes it a string not a nubmer and cannot do math with
        - comparison operators 
            - compare two bvalues and return  true or false

        - logical operators 
            - combine  expressions and return true or false
