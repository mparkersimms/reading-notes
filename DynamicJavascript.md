### How HTML, CSS, and Javascript Fit Together

HTML  
-content layer  

CSS  
-Presentation layer  

Javascript  
-behavior layer  
-written in plain text  
- the example in the lab / textbook today was about making a greeting for a webpage that chages depending on the time of day. 
    - check my repository on Dynamic web pages for the code

Best practice to have a separate javascript file to reference inside the html instead of writting it all in one file.   

apply javascript in html by adding 
``` <script></script>```  

source the code in the tags by 
```<script> src="javascriptfile.js"></script>```

### How to Use Objects and Methods

the **object** is what you want to affect,   

the **member operator** is the dot between the object  and the member you want to access   

The **method** is what you want to do to the object.   

**parameters** are the piece of information 

### Statements 

a script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one by one.   
Each individual instruction is called a **statement** and should end in a semicolon.  

### Comments

comments help you make notes inside the code that will not appear in the code itself  

-multiline comment-
```/* this is a multiline comment*/```

-singleline comment-
```// this is a single line comment```

### Variables 

temporarily stored bits of information.   
```var``` is the variable key word   
follwed by a space and then the variable name and a semi colon  
eg: ``` var quantity;```

assignment operator tells the variable what you want it to do   
eg: ```quantity = 3```  
and themn the variable name is what you want to assign the variable

### Data Types

Numeric data - numbers   
String data Type -  letters and other characters   
Boolean data type -  true or false
